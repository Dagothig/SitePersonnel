				<strong>Tiny Religion</strong><br><br>
				This game was made for the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&amp;uid=11227">Ludum Dare 23</a>. <br>
				A simple playthrough can be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3AgFT01xwo">here</a>. <br>
				It's about making your god happy by doing stuff which mostly consists of doing babies (yes, in this game you <i>do</i> babies) and build bridges. <br>
				The interface is text-based and instructions to use it can be accessed in-game, there is also a list of the possible commands in this page.<br><br>
				The game was made in C# with the XNA framework and thus, sadly, can only be run under Windows as well as requiring the .net framework and the 
				XNA framework to be installed.
